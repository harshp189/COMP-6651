# COMP-6651 Project
# CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY | ALGORITHM DESIGN TECHNIQUES | WINTER 2022

In accordance with the public health instituteâ€™s social distancing rules, some health centers, including hospitals, have decided to orient and label (color) their hallways/corridors as one-way or two-way hallways/corridors for COVID or non-COVID patients, so that COVID patients move along red paths, in hallway/corridors lanes labeled red, and non-COVID patients would move along green lanes, consisting of green labeled hallway/corridors lanes. It is assumed that lanes are wider enough in order to satisfy the social distancing rules. In addition, patients must be spaced far enough apart to again satisfy these last rules..
The project is then about how to define the directions and the color labels of the corridor lanes, in order to make sure that for any two locations, there is a green path and a red path going from one direction to the next.
